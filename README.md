## Packages

Install packages with npm

```bash
npm install
```

## Deployment

Deployment of this project will use Firebase

First, build your application on the command line:
```bash
npm run build
```
Then, install the Firebase CLI globally to the node modules:
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```
If you donâ€™t have a Firebase project yet, sign up for a Firebase account and create a new project there. Then you can associate the Firebase CLI with the Firebase account (Google account):

```bash
  npm run deploy
```
